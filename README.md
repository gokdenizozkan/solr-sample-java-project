# Solr Sample Java App

This is a project demonstrating how to implement Solr and its API SolrJ in Java.

## Why

I attended the latest n11 TalentHub Bootcamp
where we were asked to write a Spring Boot application.
The objective was to make a clone of food order services
that brings local restaurants with customers.

We were to use Solr. However, using Solr with a project required more dirty work
than any other technologies supported by Spring out of the box.
So, I spent my 3 days researching how to use and implement Solr.
To ease the process of getting started for others, like you, I created this sample project.

Also, see my Medium article for a more detailed guide on how to use Solr with latest Spring Boot versions:
